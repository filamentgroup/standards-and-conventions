## Repository Maintenance

### Repository States

* _Active_: the default, if unspecified a repository is in this state.
* _Unmaintained_: Code is still in a workable state but unsupported and not responding to new issues or accepting any new pull requests.
    * [Example](https://github.com/filamentgroup/jQuery-Equal-Heights)
* _Retired_: Code should not be used. Approach has been deprecated or folded into another repository. Also has the properties of being unmaintained (per above).
    * [Example](https://github.com/filamentgroup/face-off/)
